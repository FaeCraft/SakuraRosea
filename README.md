# Sakura Rosea

Sakura Rosea is a Minecraft mod which is dedicated to Autumnalis Rosea, the pink cherry blossom tree. It includes
a number of sakura-related blocks and trees, a sakura forest biome (plus sakura forest hills variant), as well as
white and pink clay and bricks. Sakura leaves produce falling pink leaf particles, and can drop cherries
(similarly to how apples are dropped).

This was our first mod, and as such the code quality isn't quite up to spec. We'll get around to cleaning
it up someday, though!

For more information (and to download the mod), please see

# Why dual license?

Sakura Rosea is distributed under both an [All Rights Reserved](LICENSE.ASSETS.md) license for assets,
and an [LGPL license](LICENSE.CODE.md) for code.
We believe in supporting the wider modding community. Many modders use code examples 
to help them learn how to work with Minecraft and the mod loader they've chosen - 
while our code may not be of an absolutely professional quality, 
we hope that its availability helps someone else with their own modding work. 

To that end, feel free to look over our code for examples of how we've solved 
the problems we encountered while writing this mod, incorporate snippets into your own,
or even backport it - just remember that [our asset specific license](LICENSE.ASSETS.md) 
means that you can't take any of the models or textures for your own projects.

We reserve the right to enforce our copyright - via the DMCA (or other country-relevant legislation), 
acquisition of teeth, or sacrifice in our weekly demonic ritual.

**This software is provided as-is, without any kind of warranty. While we do our best to avoid serious bugs,
we take no responsibility for our mods pouring glue in your keyboard, deleting System32, turning your Roomba
into a soul sucking demon, or any other possible negative effects.**

# Forge

As an extra note, I want to put on record that we won't support the porting of our mods to Forge.
We don't own concepts and you can do whatever you want with ideas, but direct ports are NOT 
permitted, and you're not allowed to use the same models and textures if you decide
to make a similar mod on another modloader
